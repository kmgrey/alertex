                                The new <a class="post-link" href="https://www.ada.ac.uk/" target="_blank">ADA National College of Digital Skills</a> 
                                recently moved its sixth form college from Tottenham Hale to new purpose-built premises in Pimlico, South London. 
                                The aim of the college is to address the talent shortage within the digital industry which is currently 
                                experiencing epic growth. The college currently houses 124 students between the ages of 16 to 19.

                                <a class="post-link" href="https://www.luminite.co.uk/" target="_blank">Luminite Electronics Ltd.</a> were contacted 
                                in Spring 2023 by <a class="post-link" href="https://triplestarfireandsecurity.com/index.html" target="_blank">Triple 
                                Star Fire and Security</a> who had been tasked to provide an effective lockdown alert system in the event of an 
                                emergency incident.  The college particularly wanted the ability to announce a warning rather than using a sounder 
                                alert and opted for <a class="post-link" href="./voice-annunciators.php" target="_blank">Alertex annunciators 
                                (NXVS)</a>. The college required the ability to choose between two key messages in response to an event requiring 
                                lockdown or an event requiring evacuation that was not fire related. Luminite worked with Triple Star Fire & Security 
                                and sent one of their technical engineers to help and advise on equipment required during the initial site survey.

                            The annunciators are fitted with flashing strobe lights which automatically turn on when the system is activated. 
                            Activation is by way of the <a class="post-link" href="./ip-bridge.php" target="_blank">Alertex IP Bridge</a> 
                            portal or via <a class="post-link" href="./call-points.php" target="_blank">call points</a> which were 
                            strategically placed around the building. The Bridge allows the college to control and monitor devices from one central 
                            location and to change messages depending on the event. The college also wanted to be able to activate annunciators 
                            from <a class="post-link" href="./key-fob.php" target="_blank">hand-held fobs</a> which were allocated to key staff. 
                            A total of 61 annunciators were supplied and as part of the Luminite service, all units were pre-programmed and the decibel level set.

                                Daren Pool, Managing Director of Triple Star Fire & Security commented ‘I have been really happy with the support that the team 
                                at Luminite provided, from our initial conversation through to their assistance with the site survey and finally their input in 
                                providing all devices pre-programmed and ready to go leading to a straightforward installation.  We know that further support 
                                is available over the phone should we require it.’

                                Laura Grainger from Luminite commented ‘This was a sizeable installation using our voice annunciators and we were happy to 
                                provide Daren and his team with as much information as they needed to get this project over the line.  As a result, Triple 
                                Star Fire and Security are now one of our approved installers for the Alertex range and we look forward to working with 
                                them on future projects within the education sector.’
