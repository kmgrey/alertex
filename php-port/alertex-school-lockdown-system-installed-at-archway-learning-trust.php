                                trust comprising primary and secondary schools and a sixth Form College located throughout the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire 
                                areas. The school has a rich history dating back to 1706 and caters for over 8,000 students.

                                Operations Manager to provide an effective lockdown alert system for a temporary site. The Academy were looking for a simple 
                                solution that they could install themselves and contacted Luminite for help and advice. Luminite supplied the Academy with 
                                test equipment to enable staff to carry out their own site survey and it was decided to install 23 sounder/beacons across the 
                                site with a master call point sitting in the Reception area. To aid The Archway Learning Trust, Luminite pre-programmed all 
                                units and set the sound and decibel level with staff members prior to despatch.

                                Leiha Varley-Hayes, Operations Manager for the Academy was looking for a system that could be installed quickly and easily 
                                by their own staff and this was a particular advantage to them choosing the Alertex system.   ’I had been really happy with 
                                the support that the team at Luminite provided in helping us explore options available for an effective lockdown alarm system. 
                                We had been able to play with the products before purchasing, which allowed us to identify the right system to use. Luminite 
                                had been really helpful for pre-setting the devices with the correct tone and volume we required and linked all the devices 
                                together for one zone to cover the proposed site. Even following our purchase further support has been offered, over phone 
                                and by email which has also been useful to help us learn how to use spare devices’ commented Leiha.

                                Laura Grainger from Luminite commented ‘We are conscious that, especially in the current climate, school budgets must be 
                                spent wisely and we were happy to supply advance demonstration units to the Archway Learning Trust in order for them to 
                                test thoroughly.  A consideration for the Trust was that they could easily add units to the system as their expansion 
                                plans grow and ALERTEX allows them to do this.’
