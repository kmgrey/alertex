                                <a class="post-link" href="https://www.discovery.greenwich.sch.uk/" target="_blank">Discovery Primary</a> is a larger than average school 
                                for over 700 pupils from 2 to 11 years and is based in Woolwich, South London. The school has a strong ethos grounded in honesty, empathy, 
                                aspiration, resilience and trust which underpins all learning. The school has a very strong sense of community and offers support and 
                                learning to pupils with special educational needs and/or disabilities.
                                <br><br>
                                There are 24 classrooms, a library, 2 large halls and extensive play areas including the Discovery Children’s Centre which is part of the school site.

                                The school is a stone’s throw from the notorious Belmarsh Prison and in 2020 experienced the aftermath of violent confrontations between 
                                police and supporters of an inmate. This led the school to review their security arrangements and in particular their lockdown procedures. 
                                The school called on <a class="post-link" href="https://www.reignsecure.co.uk/" target="_blank">Reign Secure Ltd (RSL)</a> who are 
                                specialists in designing, installing and maintaining a wide range of security and fire systems. They work closely with Videcon, a 
                                renowned security distributor and Luminite were contacted to attend site with RSL to ascertain what was needed. 
                                <br><br>
                                Due to the unique geography of the school premises in relation to Belmarsh it was suggested that a combination of voice annunciators 
                                for outside areas be used alongside sounders. The annunciators give a clear spoken alert to pupils and staff throughout the 
                                extensive external areas that the school has.

                                site surveys is a must for companies tasked with installing our lockdown system and we were happy to attend site with RSL. Walking 
                                the premises with the school’s estate manager enabled us to understand the unique issues facing this particular school and the 
                                potential pinch-points that required special attention.’
                                <br><br>
                                Adam Cooper, Director of RSL said ‘Installing the Alertex lockdown system at Discovery school has given the staff and pupils 
                                added security in the unlikely event it’s needed to be used. The installation process is quick and easy with minimal disruption 
                                to the school and was completed in two days’
