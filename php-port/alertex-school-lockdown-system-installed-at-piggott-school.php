                                The Piggott School is a Church of England school based in Wargrave near Reading, Berkshire. The school caters for all 
                                ages from 4 to 18 years and has over 1700 pupils. Piggott School has a strong Christian ethos with its main values of 
                                respect, equality, honesty, dedication, courage and love acting as building blocks throughout its teachings.

                                Luminite were contacted in the Spring of 2021 by the School’s Finance Officer to provide an effective lockdown alert 
                                system for the site including outdoor areas around the school’s football pitch. They were looking for a simple solution 
                                that they could install themselves and contacted Luminite for help and advice. In June 2021 Piggott School ordered 34 
                                Alertex devices including <a class="post-link" href="./sounders-and-beacons.php" target="_blank">combined 
                                sounder/beacons</a> with built in call points as well as <a class="post-link" href="./call-points.php" 
                                target="_blank">call points only</a> and sounder/beacons only. External devices were also ordered for outdoor areas. 
                                The School were also supplied with an IP Bridge which allows units to be controlled and monitored from one central location.

                                A year after the installation, Luminite were contacted again by the School to provide a further 7 sounder/beacons. 
                                Laura Grainger from Luminite commented ‘This is one of the main strengths of the Alertex system – the fact that it 
                                can grow with a site and more units can be quickly and simply added.’

                                James Fisher, the Network Manager at Piggott School commented – “We have been very happy with the Luminite alarm 
                                system, everything is so simple from install to maintenance and use.”

                                “The monitoring is easy to set up and the batteries last an extremely long time for a wireless system. The 
                                <a class="post-link" href="./ip-bridge.php" target="_blank">IP Bridge</a> is key to its success in my opinion, with 
                                its battery monitoring, email alerts for the alarm activation location or tampering/faults etc it makes it 
                                largely a hands off system for us whilst retaining peace of mind. We are also looking to add this to our 
                                primary school as well in the coming year.”
