                        All schools must have a <span class="yellow-text">Lockdown policy</span> in place that outlines their action plan for the restriction of movement during an emergency situation. 
                        A lockdown policy aims to prevent people from freely entering, leaving, or moving around an area to minimise disruption and danger.
                        <br><br>
                        In line with OFSTED guidance the <span class="yellow-text">Lockdown system</span> should provide an audible and/or visual alert that is specific to a scenario requiring free movement to be restricted. The Lockdown system should look and sound different to a fire alarm, and should provide a clear alert swiftly and reliably.

                        <p>
                            The Alertex Wireless Critical Alert System forms an interconnecting wireless mesh network between all units on the same site code. When one unit is activated, 
                            it will activate all other units on the same site. The maximum line of sight wireless range for Alertex units is 1km, and units can be set to repeat the signal, 
                            which in turn extends the wireless transmission range.
                            <br><br>
                            The Alertex system can be activated by any call-point or key fob within range of a main unit, or remotely from a central location using the Alertex web portal and IP bridge.
                            <br><br>
                            The system is fully standalone and requires no wires or cabling. Units are battery-powered with a long battery-life of up to 2-years.

                    <h2>Why do you need a Lockdown system?</h2>
                    <p>
                        An emergency Lockdown System is now an essential part of any preparedness plan for institutions with a duty of care to students, staff, and the general public. 
                        As a Lockdown scenario requires a different response to a Fire scenario, using a dedicated Lockdown System is preferred, as outlined in 
                        the <a class="p-link" href="https://www.protectuk.police.uk/evacuation-invacuation-lockdown-protected-spaces" target="_blank">‘Evacuation, 
                        invacuation, lockdown, protected spaces’ guidance</a> provided by NaCTSO:
                    </p>
                    <p class="quote">
                        “In some emergency scenarios such as a terrorist attack, the appropriate response may be not to evacuate. Where evacuation may be required, 
                        the evacuation response may differ to that of a fire. For example, people may be directed to specific exits or to avoid a particular route or area.
                        <br><br>
                        For this reason, it is suggested the activation of the fire alarm to initiate evacuation should be avoided to reduce the possibility of an 
                        incorrect response. Public Address (Tannoy) systems, if available, may provide more flexibility to provide information and instructions 
                        appropriate to the scenario and to provide positive confirmation to staff and visitors that the emergency is real. 
                        This will help to reduce any potential delay in response.”
